# Machine Learning-Driven Apartment Price Prediction in Daegu

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that predicts property prices using the Random Forrest Regressor model. The model is trained with a dataset that includes features such as hallway type, time to subway, number of amenities nearby, year built, property size, and more.

## Project Description

he primary goal of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** that can accurately **predict apartment prices** in Daegu. By leveraging various factors such as apartment type, proximity to transportation, amenities, and historical market data, this model will provide real estate agencies with reliable pricing recommendations. The main goal is to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and offer a strategic advantage in a highly competitive and challenging market.

## Model Features

The model involves several stages of data preprocessing, including:
- SimpleImputer 
- OrdinalEncoder
- OneHotEncoder
- Feature engineering to improve model performance

## Repository Structure
- `data_daegu_apartment.csv`: Dataset for model building process.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the entire analysis and model building process.
- `final_random_forest_model.pkl`: Machine learning model that has been trained and stored.
- `Daegu Apartment.docx`: Information about each feature in the dataset.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Install the dependencies using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
3. Open `ML.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run all cells in the notebook to see the analysis process and prediction results.
